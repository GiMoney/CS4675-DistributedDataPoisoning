## Goals ##
Try to work on on newer or interesting (significant like healthcare, face data, etc.) data set
Download face dataset on kaggle that has a model attached, add poisoning to it
Model you know is 
Do poisoning attack on pretrained model, break up data (partitions)
Let the data partitions be different clients 
instead of creating different clients, run each data partitions iteratively on an individual system (different partitions = different clients)
Two approaches for poisoning
Data flipping (just modify the label) maybe 10% of data, but the rest have correct label
Use prof’s student’s, Leo’s code (easy to use), and reproduce it
All we have to ch
